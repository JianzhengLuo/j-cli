Autocompletion, smooth remotion, directly-code-applying, auto-gui-building and so on.

## Statement

Once I found there is one that does exactly things with this one and it started developing earlier and is better, I will stop developing this project. Or in another better case, I am the one who had the idea first, I will keep developing.

Unluckily, I can't pay too much attention on this, through I wanted so. Because I am a student in China, the ethical and stable thing I should do is study text books hard and get best scores for more then ten years, finally get a good score in college-entering-exams and enter a good college then I could start my hobby or just working.

Although most parents in China think that's the thing all students should do, my parents and me don't think so. But as I said, that's the most stable. I was born in a normal family, my father is a teacher and my mother is a saleswoman. I don't have much money to chase my dream. My parents encourage me to do the things I like and even can get bad scores (I do well in my school now). But as the only child in my family, I felt the duty on my shoulder and I also have to make a life. That can be done with studying hard and getting high scores. But that also means I have to spend less time on my hobbies. I love studying - poems, biology, geography, geometry, chemistry and so on. Those really attract me. But I also need to get good scores in exams, that really takes a lot of time.

Maybe if I can get a job at Google or Microsoft or other WLB companies in the future - I can have time to develop, or nice donations - I can both learn those in my school years- without spending much time on exams and spend more time on developing while making a life.

## Donation

I will not asking for donations until I work out the first version.
